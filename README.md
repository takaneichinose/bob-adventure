# Bob Adventure

# This application is still in development

## Description

Simple platformer game I made to practice my skill in creating a specification of a game, and also its development.

## Tools

Below are the tools I used for the development:

1. [Phaser](http://phaser.io); The game engine I used for development
1. [Parcel](https://parceljs.org); To bundle the package of my source codes.
1. [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org); To make the source code readable (In my opinion).
1. [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com); Though minimal, I used this for styling
1. MS Paint; Drawing the image assets
1. [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net); Drawing the image assets
1. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/); The development environment.
1. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com); The package manager I used to install dependencies, etc.
1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com); The editor I used.
